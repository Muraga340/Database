 Compiling Data

This could involve gathering data from various sources, cleaning it, and preparing it for analysis. For example, if you're working with Python, you might use pandas for data manipulation.

python
Copy code
# Example code for data compilation
import pandas as pd

# Read data from CSV file
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Display the first few rows
print(data.head())
Task 2: Ingest data into Hadoop data lake
(ii) Ingesting Data

Using tools like Apache Hadoop, you might ingest the compiled data into your Hadoop cluster.

bash
Copy code
# Example command for ingesting data into Hadoop
hadoop fs -put local_file_path hadoop_destination_path
Task 3: Extract data using PySpark
(iii) Extracting Data Using PySpark

PySpark can be used to extract and process data from Hadoop.

python
Copy code
# Example code for extracting data using PySpark
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Create Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName('data_extraction').getOrCreate()

# Read data from Hadoop
data = spark.read.csv('hadoop_destination_path')
data.show()
Task 4: Pre-processing tasks
(iv) Pre-processing Data

This could involve handling missing values, encoding categorical data, scaling numerical features, etc.

python
Copy code
# Example code for pre-processing data
from sklearn.preprocessing import Imputer
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Handle missing values
imputer = Imputer(strategy='mean')
data['column_name'] = imputer.fit_transform(data[['column_name']])

# Scaling numerical features
scaler = StandardScaler()
data['numerical_column'] = scaler.fit_transform(data[['numerical_column']])
Task 5: Test results and interpretations
(v) Test Results and Interpretations

This depends on the specific analysis or tests you've performed on your data. For instance, if you're running a regression model:

python
Copy code
# Example code for testing a regression model
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Split data into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Fit a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model
score = model.score(X_test, y_test)
print("Model Score:", score)
Task 6: Validation results and interpretations
(vi) Validation Results and Interpretations

Validation could involve assessing model performance, checking for overfitting, etc.

python
Copy code
# Example code for model validation
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate mean squared error
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)
print("Mean Squared Error:", mse)
Task 7: Potential applications of interpreted results
